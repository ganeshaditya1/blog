At the time when TCP/IP stack was created internet was still in it's infantcy. Before TCP/IP it was more common for a 
few gigantic routers centarally located in a few universities to hold all the routing information. OSI model and subsequently TCP/IP model which were the models on which internet runs today, fundamentally changed the landscape of networking. Rather than a few large routers responsible for all the routing happening on the network, several smaller routers that act like a distributed network were created to form the Internet. A lot of the features in TCP are for routing packets over an unrealiable network spawning the whole entire planet i.e the internet. A lot of these features are overkill for datacenter networking. In the coming decades several people are predicitng that TCP will be 
phased out of datacenters completely.
