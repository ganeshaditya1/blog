synopsis: "This is the first blog post in the series of blog posts that I intend to write. In this series I explore the frontend landscape, along with some of the most important front end technologies as a primarily backend engineer. In this first post, I explore three types of tools that are involved in the creation of a frontend system. All three are involved in the build process of a frontend system. I will first start with transpillers. Then move on to package management systems. And then finally bundling software that actually creates deployable frontend software. I explore various tools in all the three categories. Talk about the tradeoffs and the exact problems that these tools solve. Along with some examples and sample code."

My job title in most of the jobs that I worked was fullstack engineer, but I would say I am predominantly a backend engineer. 
I can still work my way around the frontend. Of late, I became curious about how modern frontend software is designed. So I decided to take a deep dive
into the world of frontend technologies. In this first post, I will cover various challenges faced when building the frontend system i.e. Transpiling, 
pulling all of the dependencies, actually building a deployable software artifact.

The general idea I had in my mind when I started exploring frontend systems is that I should try to learn the science behind frontend technologies. I will first 
start by understanding what are the major problems in designing and building a frontend system. Then analyzing each of these problems a little bit more, 
exploring various approaches people have taken to solving these problems. Exploring various tools that were created for solving these problems. 
The tradeoffs these tools make. Finally doing a bit of experimentation to actually watch these tools solve the problem. Tools, libraries 
and frameworks are not the focus of these blog series, even though it may seem that I am primarily exploring various tools. 

Secondly I want to say that a lot of people seem to think that frontend engineering is not real engineering work. It is more of a creative field concerned
with the asthetics of the website. In the past few weeks that I have spend learning frontend technologies, the one thing I have realized is that frontend
work is just as challenging as backend work and requires quantitative, problem solving skills. Frontend engineering involves a lot of performance tuning as
well.

Thirdly I am assuming that you are a backend engineer like me. Someone who primarily codes in langauages like Java or Rust or Go or Kotlin. Not a NodeJs
developer. Because if you are a NodeJs developer you will not get much value out of reading these posts. Your idea of how to build a website is to create
a HTML file, add a bunch of tags to create the overall structure of the website. Add some CSS to style the tags. Finally add some Javascript to make the
whole thing interactive. And the way all of this is tied together is using script tags or style tags that import the script/style files located in the same 
repo as your HTML files. This was largely the case up until 2014 when I was in college. In the last few years, things have changed tremendously with the
invention of libraries/frameworks like React, Tailwind etc. 

# Search engine rankings - The way websites get compared

When you are building a website, you want it to rank higher in the search rankings. That way you will get a lot of traffic to your site. Search engines
have a really complicated way for score websites. Some of that information about how websites are ranked is public, a lot of it is secret. Obviously having
good unique content helps your website score higher. Another thing that helps your website score higher is when your users have a good experiences using
your website. As a developer you might not really have a lot of control over the content in your website. But you can ensure that your visitors have a
good experience when visiting your website. Google has a nice article explaining what makes for a good user experience [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience)

There are some general heuristics that you need to follow to ensure your users have a good experience like not overloading your website with ads or showing 
way too many popups etc. In addition to these heuristics, there are some objective metrics as well called core web vitals. Different search engines might
have different names for this, but this is what Google calls them. There are three metrics that are used to measure your website's core web vitals:

- [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) This is a metric that meaures how long it took for your website to load. 
Having an LCP under 2.5 seconds is a good score according to google.
- [Interaction To Next Paint (INP)](https://web.dev/articles/inp) This is an aggregate metric that measures how long it took for your website to
respond to various user interactions. I.e. this metric measures how responsive your website is. Ideally this score should be less than 200 milliseconds
- [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/articles/cls). This measures how stable your web page is. If your webpage is constantly loading
fresh new data and the content is constantly shifting around, it makes for a bad user experience. A score on this metric less than 0.1 is desirable.

Now you might be wondering how do search engines measure these metrics? Well 66% of the internet users use Google Chrome according to 
[this](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/) website. So in Google's case at least it is just watching people interact with your website on
Google chrome and collecting these metrics live. So if 10% of your users who use Chrome have a bad experience, Google would know about it and they would
give you a low score. Other search engines like Bing which is owned by Microsoft who also own Edge browser might be doing something similar too. 

So obviously if you want your website to rank higher in search rankings, you need to improve your score on these metrics. Google has a tool called 
[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) which is integrated into Chrome browser that you can use to measure your score against 
these metrics. Lighthouse gives you a scores, warnings and tips about other areas too that you need to focus on to improve your overall search engine
rankings.
