(Me in May 2025)

# HELLO WORLD !!

My name is Aditya Ambadipudi. I am a software engineer. I have travelled extensively all over the world. 
I was born in India and lived there for 23 years. Then I moved to the US and lived there for around 10 years. 
While there I got my masters degree in Computer Science and I also worked there for around 8 years. I love computers and computer science. 
My tryst with computers began in 3rd grade when my father bought a Cyrix computer with 64mb of ram and 8GB of hard disk space.
Over the course of the last 2.5 decades I have acquired several computers. Spent a significant chunk of my time learning 
the inner workings of these magical devices. Wrote software for them, some of which you might have used in the past.

I am also an avid Chess fan. I do a lot of Chess puzzles in my free time. In the past I have came across several incredibly interesting 
Chess puzzles and tricky positions in my games. I thought it would be interesting to share them with them with everyone. Which is also another
reason why I choose to create this blog.
